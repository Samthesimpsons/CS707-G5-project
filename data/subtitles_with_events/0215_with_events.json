BURKE: No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm\nOK' head bob. [demonstrates] 'I'm OK.' [tilts head] 'You sure?' [bobs head] 'Yeah, I'm\nfine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the\ndivorce only left me with 4 CD's to change. MONICA: [her and Phoebe tilt their heads] Oh, that's too bad. DR.

[Since they're alone they start kissing and Ross's hands work their way down until they're\non Rachel's butt. Rachel starts laughing.] ROSS: What, what. RACHEL: I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my\nbutt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry. ROSS: And that's, that's funny why? RACHEL: Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya\nknow, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing. ROSS: I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big. RACHEL: OK. [start kissing again and Rachel starts lauging again] ROSS: OK, my hands were no where near your butt. RACHEL: I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the\nlast time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm\nnot gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there. ROSS: No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.",

Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the\ndivorce only left me with 4 CD's to change. MONICA: [her and Phoebe tilt their heads] Oh, that's too bad. DR.

RACHEL: Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya\nknow, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
