They're sitting on the couch when they have an argument about taking a break from each other due to some issues that arose between them recently.\nRoss starts off by saying he needs space because of certain things she did lately which hurt him deeply; however, before long it becomes clear there were problems within both parties involved here too \u2013 particularly with how much time either one spending away at work instead being present for another person emotionally speaking .
