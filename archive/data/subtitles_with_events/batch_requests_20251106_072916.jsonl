You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\nMONICA: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince.

I miss her.\nMONICA: What does she mean by 'involved'?\nCHANDLER: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.\nROSS: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.\nRACHEL: So what are you gonna do?\nROSS: I have no idea.

Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\nMONICA: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\nMRS. GELLER: Well, they don't have to know that...

GELLER: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.\nMONICA: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\nMRS. GELLER: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\nMR. GELLER: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\nMRS. GELLER: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\nMONICA: What's that supposed to mean?\nMRS. GELLER: Nothing! It's an expression.\nMONICA: No it's not.\nMR. GELLER: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\nMR. GELLER: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\nMR. GELLER: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\nMONICA: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\nROSS: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\nMRS.

You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.\nDAVID: Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.\nPHOEBE: Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'.

Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.\nJOEY: I'm...happy...for you?\nMRS. TRIBBIANI: Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.\nJOEY: Ma, I'm sorry.

Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.\nRACHEL: (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?\nINTERCOM: Animal Control.\nRACHEL: See? I've even called Animal Control!\nROSS: You called Animal Control?\nRACHEL: Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?\nROSS: Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city.

We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.\nLUISA: Marcel?\nROSS: My uncle Marcel.\nPHOEBE: Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?\nLUISA: Oookay.

(To Rachel) But you? What a bitch !\nRACHEL: What?!\nMONICA: Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake?

And they're very hot.\nJOEY: We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.\nCHANDLER: Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.\nJOEY: Marcel?\nCHANDLER: Marcel?!\nPHOEBE: Marcel?\nMONICA: Marcel?\nPHOEBE: Marcel?\nBOTH: Marcel?\nPHOEBE: Oh-my-God!\nMONICA: Whaaat!\nPHOEBE: Something just brushed up against my right leg!\nMONICA: What is it?\nPHOEBE: Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.\nMONICA: Look, Phoebe!\nPHOEBE: Yeah!

(Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?\nPHOEBE: Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah.\nMONICA: Oh gosh.\nROSS: Marcel?\nRACHEL: Marcel?\nROSS: Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.\nRACHEL: Ross, you don't know that.\nROSS: Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village.

You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!\nROSS: Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!\nRACHEL: Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.\nROSS: Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...\nRACHEL: Ross.\nROSS: I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...\nRACHEL: Ross.\nROSS: Oh, forget it, okay?\nRACHEL: Ross!\nROSS: What?

HECKLES: What about it?\nROSS: Gimme back my monkey.\nMR. HECKLES: I don't have a monkey.\nRACHEL: Then what's with all the bananas?\nMR. HECKLES: Potassium.\nROSS: Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?\nROSS: Marcel! What've you done to him?\nMR. HECKLES: That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.\nROSS: Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.

HECKLES: That's my monkey.\nLUISA: You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.\nMR. HECKLES: That's not my monkey.

HECKLES: You're doing it again.\nMONICA: We're not doing anything.\nMR. HECKLES: You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.\nRACHEL: You don't have birds.\nMR. HECKLES: I could have birds.\nMONICA: Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.\nMR. HECKLES: Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.\nRACHEL: All right, bye-bye.\nCHANDLER: Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.\nROSS: We'll give you Janice.\nPHOEBE: I miss Janice though. \"Hello, Chandler Bing.\"\nRACHEL: \"Oh, my, god.\"\nJOEY: \"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!\"\nMONICA: Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.\nRACHEL: We won. We won!\nMONICA: Mr. Heckles.\nRACHEL: How did this happen?\nMR. TREEGER: He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.\nMONICA: That's terrible.\nMR. TREEGER: I know. I was sweepin' ye\nMR. TREEGER: You never know.\nPHOEBE: Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!\nCHANDLER: Ok, Phoebe.\nPHOEBE: I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.\nJOEY: Such as?\nPHOEBE: Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?\nROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?\nPHOEBE: Nah. Not really.\nROSS: You don't believe in evolution?\nPHOEBE: I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.\nROSS: Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?\nPHOEBE: Yeah, I just don't buy it.\nROSS: Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.\nPHOEBE: Ok, don't get me started on gravity.\nROSS: You uh, you don't believe in gravity?\nPHOEBE: Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.\nCHANDLER: Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.\nMR. TREEGER: There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.\nMONICA: What can we do for you?\nMR. BOYLE: All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to \"the noisy girls in the apartment above mine\".\nMONICA: Well, what about his family?\nMR. BOYLE: He didn't have any.\nRACHEL: Ok, so let's talk money.\nMR. BOYLE: All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.\nMONICA: I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!\nRACHEL: Have you ever seen so much crap?\nCHANDLER: Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap\nJOEY: Check this out. Can I have this?\nROSS: How can you not believe in evolution?\nPHOEBE: Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!\nROSS: Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.\nPHOEBE: Really? You can actually see it?\nROSS: You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.\nPHOEBE: See, I didn't know that.\nROSS: Well, there you go.\nPHOEBE: Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?\nCHANDLER: Hey, look at this. \"My Big Book of Grievances.\"\nJOEY: Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.\nCHANDLER: April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.\nRACHEL: Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.\nMONICA: Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.\nRACHEL: What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.\nMONICA: It doesn't go with any of my stuff.\nRACHEL: Well, what about my stuff?\nMONICA: You don't have any stuff.\nRACHEL: You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?\nMONICA: No.\nRACHEL: Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.\nMONICA: Mmmmm.\nRACHEL: Ok, while you \"mmm\" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.\nROSS: Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?\nPHOEBE: Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.\nROSS: Please tell me you're joking.\nPHOEBE: Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.\nROSS: No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--\nPHOEBE: What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.\nROSS: Is there blood coming out of my ears?\nJOEY: Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.\nCHANDLER: Wow, he looks so normal.\nPHOEBE: He's even kind of cute.\nJOEY: \"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.\nCHANDLER: Funniest? Heckles?\nJOEY: That's what it says.\nCHANDLER: Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?\nPHOEBE: I'd call that excessive.\nCHANDLER: Whoa!\nJOEY: What?\nCHANDLER: Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.\nJOEY: So, you were both dorks. Big deal.\nCHANDLER: I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?\nJOEY: Have you been here all night?\nCHANDLER: Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.\nJOEY: Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.\nCHANDLER: Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.\nJOEY: All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.\nCHANDLER: What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it \"supposably\"?\nJOEY: Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.\nCHANDLER: How do you know that? How?\nJOEY: I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.\nCHANDLER: You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?\nJOEY: Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?\nCHANDLER: Yeah, I understand.\nJOEY: You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?\nCHANDLER: You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.\nJOEY: Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.\nCHANDLER: (on phone) Hi, it's me.\nJANICE: Oh, my, god.\nPHOEBE: Janice? You called Janice?\nCHANDLER: Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?\nROSS: You remember Janice, right?\nCHANDLER: Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.\nJANICE: Helloo!!\nCHANDLER: Oh, my, god!\nJOEY: Geez, look how fat she got.\nJANICE: Hey, it's everybody.\nCHANDLER: Janice, you're--\nJANICE: Yes, I am.\nCHANDLER: Is it--?\nJANICE: Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.\nCHANDLER: Congratulations.\nJANICE: Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.\nCHANDLER: You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?\nJANICE: And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.\nMONICA: Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?\nRACHEL: What?\nMONICA: Hide the Lamp.\nRACHEL: Monica, let it go.\nMONICA: Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?\nRACHEL: Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.\nPHOEBE: Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.\nROSS: Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.\nPHOEBE: Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.\nROSS: It's the only possibility, Phoebe.\nPHOEBE: Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?\nROSS: There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.\nPHOEBE: I can't believe you caved.\nROSS: What?\nPHOEBE: You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?\nRACHEL: I am. Let me just get my coat.\nMONICA: Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.\nRACHEL: Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?\nMONICA: Phoebe, tell her!\nPHOEBE: Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.\nRACHEL: Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.\nCHANDLER: Neat. I'm gonna die alone.\nRACHEL: Ok, you win.\nMONICA: Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.\nCHANDLER: Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.\nPHOEBE: Uh huh. Why is that?\nCHANDLER: If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. \"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,\" they'll shout!\nMONICA: You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.\nCHANDLER: Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.\nRACHEL: Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.\nMONICA: You are not a freak. You're a guy.\nRACHEL: She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.\nMONICA: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.\nCHANDLER: In a bad way?\nMONICA: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.\nRACHEL: Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.\nPHOEBE: Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!\nMONICA: You made it!\nPHOEBE: You're there!\nRACHEL: You are ready to make a commitment!\nCHANDLER: Whoa! Don't know about that.\nRACHEL: What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?\nMONICA: No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.\nRACHEL: Thank you.\nMONICA: That's fine.\nCHANDLER: Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.\nJOEY: Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?\nCHANDLER: I'll take that.\nJOEY: You want his yearbook?\nCHANDLER: Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.\nMONICA: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.\nRACHEL: It's really not that big!\nCHANDLER: Takin' that with you, huh?\nJOEY: Oh, yeah.\nROSS: You comin'?\nCHANDLER: Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.\nALISON: Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see \"Philosopher wanted\"?\nCHANDLER: Sure. (My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work.

I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?\nCHANDLER: What?\nJADE: I got a little drunk...and naked.\nCHANDLER: Bob here.\nCHANDLER: (on phone) What've you been up to?\nJADE: Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.\nCHANDLER: Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (to Ross) I love her.\nROSS: I know.\nCHANDLER: I'm back.\nJADE: So, are we gonna get together or what?\nCHANDLER: Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?\nJADE: Great, I'll see you then.\nCHANDLER: Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.\nROSS: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, \"hey, you're not Bob.\"\nCHANDLER: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.\nROSS: Oh my god.

Yeah, it's like they're always saying \"let's go here, let's go there\". Like we can afford to go here and there.\nPHOEBE: Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know?

It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.\nJOEY: If it's not you, this is a horrible story.\nMONICA: Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.\nJOEY: Yeah, someplace nice. (to Phoebe and Rachel) How much do you think I can get for my kidney? (at Central Perk)\nROSS: I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.\nCHANDLER: Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.\nROSS: That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.\nCHANDLER: We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.\nROSS: Go over there and tell that woman the truth.\nCHANDLER: All right.\nROSS: Go.\nCHANDLER: Hi.\nJADE: Hi.\nCHANDLER: Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.\nJADE: Yes?\nCHANDLER: Whoever stood you up is a jerk.\nJADE: How did you--?\nCHANDLER: I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?\nJADE: Thanks.\nCHANDLER: No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.\nROSS: Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--\nMONICA: Who is also in charge of purchasing.\nROSS: Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--\nMONICA: Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.\nROSS: Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--\nMONICA: Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!\nJOEY: Cool.\nPHOEBE: Let's see!\nROSS: That's fine, I'll just wait!\nMONICA: Oh, sorry.\nJOEY: Sorry, sorry.\nROSS: Monica!\nWAITER: Are we ready to order?\nRACHEL: Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.\nWAITER: Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.\nPHOEBE: Wow, look at these prices.\nRACHEL: Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.\nJOEY: What are these, like famous chickens?\nCHANDLER: Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?\nROSS: Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?\nCHANDLER: Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.\nROSS: Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?\nWAITER: Do I dare ask?\nMONICA: Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.\nROSS: That sounds great. Same for me.\nWAITER: And for the gentleman?\nJOEY: Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?\nWAITER: You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?\nRACHEL: Ok, I will have the uh, (whispers) side salad.\nWAITER: (whispers) And what will that be on the side of?\nRACHEL: Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?\nWAITER: And for you?\nPHOEBE: Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.\nCHANDLER: I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.\nWAITER: Anything else?\nCHANDLER: Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?\nROSS: (using calculator) Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.\nRACHEL: Um, everyone?\nROSS: Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.\nJOEY: Thank you.\nROSS: Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.\nMONICA: Oh, thank you!\nROSS: So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.\nPHOEBE: No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.\nCHANDLER: Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.\nPHOEBE: I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks?

Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?\nRACHEL: Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.\nMONICA: If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.\nROSS: G-gift? The thing's not the gift?\nCHANDLER: No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.\nROSS: Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.\nPHOEBE: No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.\nROSS: No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.\nMONICA: All of us.\nCHANDLER: Together.\nROSS: Not at the concert.\nRACHEL: Ok.\nJOEY: Yeah.\nRACHEL: Thank you.\nJOEY: Thanks.\nPHOEBE: Yeah.\nCHANDLER: So, the ebola virus.

Let's take a look.\nPHOEBE: Oh, it's like a skit.\nMONICA: Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.\nROSS: Whoo!\nPHOEBE: Cool.\nMONICA: Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.\nROSS: But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?\nCHANDLER: By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.\nROSS: Come on.\nCHANDLER: Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!\nMONICA: It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.\nPHOEBE: So...Thank you.\nROSS: Could you be less enthused?\nJOEY: Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--\nMONICA: Like?\nJOEY: Charity.\nMONICA: Charity?\nROSS: We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.\nRACHEL: Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.\nPHOEBE: Actually, it makes us feel that big.\nROSS: I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.\nCHANDLER: If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.\nJOEY: Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.\nRACHEL: Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.\nPHOEBE: I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.\nRACHEL: Me neither.\nJOEY: Me too.\nMONICA: Guys, we bought the tickets.\nPHOEBE: Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.\nCHANDLER: Why did you look at me when you said that?\nMONICA: Well, I guess now we can't go.\nRACHEL: What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?\nMONICA: You know what? You're right.\nPHOEBE: Fine.\nROSS: Fine.\nJOEY: Fine.\nCHANDLER: Fine.\nRACHEL: Fine.\nMONICA: All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours.

You had sex today?\nCHANDLER: Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.\nROSS: Wow.\nCHANDLER: Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.\nROSS: Still doing the screening thing?\nCHANDLER: I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.\nMACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.\nJADE: Hey, Bob, it's Jade.

In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.\nCHANDLER: So, uh, how was he?\nJADE: Eh.\nCHANDLER: Eh?\nJADE: Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.\nCHANDLER: Well, that makes me feel so good.\nJADE: It was just so awkward and bumpy.\nROSS: (silently mouthing) Bumpy?\nCHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.\nJADE: Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?\nMONICA: You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.\nROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.\nCHANDLER: So, let's go.\nROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.\nCHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.\nMONICA: You know, the guys are probably having a great time.\nJOEY: Come on you guys, one more time.\nPHOEBE: Ok. One.\nJOEY: Nooo.\nMONICA: That was amazing!\nROSS: Excellent, that was excellent.\nCHANDLER: I can't believe the guys missed this.\nROSS: What guys?

Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?\nROSS: Hey, you guys.\nRACHEL: Happy birthday.\nROSS: Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?\nRACHEL: Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?\nMONICA: Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?\nRACHEL: Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?\nMONICA: Uh, good.\nROSS: Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.\nCHANDLER: Yeah, we really missed you guys.\nJOEY: Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.\nPHOEBE: We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?\nMONICA: No, I just, I fell down.\nRACHEL: On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?\nMONICA: You know, a party, or--\nRACHEL: What party?\nROSS: It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.\nJOEY: You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?\nCHANDLER: Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.\nRACHEL: Who gave you that hickey?\nMONICA: That would be the work of a Blowfish.\nRACHEL: Oh!\nPHOEBE: Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, \"hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck\".\nROSS: Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.\nRACHEL: What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?\nMONICA: It's work.\nCHANDLER: I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.\nJOEY: And we don't work hard?\nMONICA: (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.\nCHANDLER: I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.\nJOEY: And you feel like we hold you back.\nCHANDLER: Yes.\nRACHEL: Oh!\nCHANDLER: No.\nMONICA: Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.\nPHOEBE: Oh.\nWAITRESS: Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.\nJOEY: Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?\nMACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.\nJADE: Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here.

I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, \"ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage.\" Little did she know God was thinking, \"Ok, but that's it.\" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.\nRACHEL: What do you mean?\nPHOEBE: I think it went into me.\nMONICA: God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.\nCHANDLER: Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.\nRACHEL: Ok, who ordered what?\nROSS: Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.\nCHANDLER: Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?\nRACHEL: Oh god.\nJOEY: I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.\nRACHEL: I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?\nPHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.\nJOEY: Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?\nPHOEBE: I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Sit up!\nMRS. GREEN: [entering] There she is.\nRACHEL: Mom!\nMRS GREEN: Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.\nRACHEL: Pretty much.\nMRS GREEN: Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.\nRACHEL: This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.\nMRS GREEN: Oh hello, Ross.\nROSS: Hi, Mrs. Green. [He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.]\nMRS GREEN: So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?\nRACHEL: Oh Mom!\nMRS GREEN: If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.\nCHANDLER: Believe me, sometimes that happens.\nMRS GREEN: This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.\nRACHEL: Really?\nMRS GREEN: Yes.\nPHOEBE: I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.\nJOEY: Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?\nPHOEBE: I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?\nMRS GREEN: Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.\nRACHEL: Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.\nMRS GREEN: [laughing] You have some life here, sweetie.\nRACHEL: I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?\nMRS GREEN: I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.\nRACHEL: For...me.\nMRS GREEN: Well, not just for you.\nRACHEL: Well, what do you mean?\nMRS GREEN: I'm uh, considering leaving your father.\nMONICA: [entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.\nRACHEL: Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.\nMONICA: Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.\nROSS: And you had no idea they weren't getting along?\nRACHEL: None.\nJOEY: They didn't fight a lot?\nRACHEL: No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?\nPHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.\nJOEY: Hey, look who's up.\nRACHEL: I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.\nMONICA: Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.\nRACHEL: Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?\nCHANDLER: You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.\nPHOEBE: That's him.\nCHANDLER: Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.\nMR A: Phoebe?\nPHOEBE: Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.\nMR A: Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.\nPHOEBE: Um, do you wanna sit?\nMR A: Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?\nPHOEBE: I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.\nMR A: You're saying, my wife is in you?\nPHOEBE: Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?\nMR A: Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.\nPHOEBE: Everything?\nMR A: Everything.\nPHOEBE: Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.\nMR A: Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.\nPHOEBE: I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.\nMR A: [to Joey] Worth a shot, huh?\nMRS GREEN: Look at this.\nRACHEL: These are from Halloween three years ago.\nMRS GREEN: Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?\nRACHEL: No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.\nMONICA: Um, you guys, you know when I said before, \"thank you, but I don't really need your help\"?\nRACHEL: Actually, what I think you said was, \"don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.\"\nMONICA: Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.\nRACHEL: Hey, Mon, you want some help?\nMONICA: If you want.\nPHOEBE: [enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.\nRACHEL: She's still with you?\nPHOEBE: Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh, such a pretty face.\nMRS GREEN: This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?\nRACHEL: God!\nMONICA: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.\nMRS GREEN: That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?\nRACHEL: Oh! What's new in sex?\nMRS GREEN: The only man I've ever been with is your father.\nMONICA: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.\nMRS GREEN: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.\nRACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?\nMRS GREEN: No.\nRACHEL: You want me to talk you out of it?\nMRS GREEN: No.\nRACHEL: Then what? What do you want?\nMRS GREEN: I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.\nRACHEL: Why on earth would I understand this?\nMRS GREEN: You didn't marry your Barry. I did.\nRACHEL: Oh.\nMONICA: All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!\nCHANDLER: Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.\nMONICA: Joey, speed it up!\nJOEY: I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!\nPHOEBE: Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.\nMONICA: Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?\nPHOEBE: Sir! No sir!\nMONICA: [to Ross] All right, you!\nROSS: No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.\nMONICA: All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called \"pigs in Ross\". All right, ball the melon.\nCHANDLER: Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.\nMONICA: Hi.\nCAROL: How's it going?\nMONICA: It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers. [everyone groans]\nCAROL: Fine, whatever.\nROSS: What's the matter?\nCAROL: Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.\nROSS: What?\nMONICA: You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.\nROSS: Carol, what's the matter? What happened?\nCAROL: My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.\nROSS: Oh my god.\nCAROL: I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.\nROSS: It's ok. I'm sorry.\nCAROL: And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.\nROSS: I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.\nCAROL: You do?\nROSS: Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.\nCAROL: Of course I do.\nROSS: Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.\nCAROL: You're right. Of course you're right.\nMONICA: So we're back on?\nCAROL: We're back on.\nMONICA: You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.\nJOEY: It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.\nCHANDLER: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.\nPHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.\nCAROL: Thank you.\nROSS: Any time. [He doesn't want to let her go]\nCAROL: Ross. [He lets her go]\nMINISTER: You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.\nPHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! [Phoebe's voice] Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.\nMONICA: Would you look at them?\nROSS: Yeah, can't help but.\nJOEY: [to a wedding guest] How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? [the guy nods] I wrapped those bad boys.\nPHOEBE: I miss Rose.\nCHANDLER: Oh, yeah?\nPHOEBE: I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.\nWOMAN: You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?\nPHOEBE: Ok, that's so nice.\nCHANDLER: [to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]\nRACHEL: Hey, Mom? Having fun?\nMRS GREEN: Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.\nRACHEL: There's more alcohol, right?\nSUSAN: How you doin'?\nROSS: Ok.\nSUSAN: You did a good thing today.\nROSS: Yeah.\nSUSAN: You wanna dance?\nROSS: No, that's fine.\nSUSAN: Come on. I'll let you lead.\nROSS: Ok.\nCHANDLER: [to the woman who just rejected him] All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. [She walks away again.]\nMONICA: Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?\nROSS: Well, Mon, I was married.\nPHOEBE: Yeah, me, too, technically.\nRACHEL: I had a wedding.\nMONICA: All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.\nJOEY: I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?

I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place\nwhere I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore. CHANDLER: Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here\nby myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware. JOEY: What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live\ntogether forever. We're not Bert and Ernie. CHANDLER: Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it. JOEY: Well that's how I feel. CHANDLER: Well then maybe you should take it. JOEY: Well then maybe I will. CHANDLER: Fine with me. JOEY: Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the\nspoons.

GELLER: She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone? ROSS: Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of\nthem aren't.

I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was. ALL: Who? JOEY: All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty. ALL: Wow! JOEY: Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to\nkiss this guy. CHANDLER: 'Cause he was just so darn cute. JOEY: No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy\nkisses. ROSS: Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. (Rachel looks at\nhim in disbelief) Or you just do it. JOEY: I did do it, I'm a professional. MONICA: Then what's the problem? JOEY: See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'.\nCan you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good\nmother.

MONICA: Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up\na little, maybe that's what you need to work on. JOEY: Yeah, that makes sense.

Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!\nROSS: Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!\nRACHEL: And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!\nROSS: Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise.

I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.\nCHANDLER: Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.\nJOEY: Yeah, we’ll be fine.\nROSS: Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.\nCHANDLER: (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever.\nPHOEBE: Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there.\nROSS: Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?\nRACHEL: All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?\nROSS: (pause) Yes I would.\nRACHEL: You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?\nROSS: (less sure) Yes.\nRACHEL: You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....\nROSS: (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!

It’s organic.\nCHANDLER: Oh great, food with hair on it.\nPHOEBE: No, not the used wax.\nCHANDLER: Because that would be crazy?\nROSS: Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.\nRACHEL: Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza.\nROSS: No anchovies.\nRACHEL: With ah, extra anchovies.\nROSS: That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off.\nRACHEL: Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?\nROSS: You can have the last piece, if you want.\nRACHEL: Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.\nPHOEBE: They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?\nCHANDLER: Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.\nMONICA: What if they don’t?\nJOEY: You think I need a new walk?\nCHANDLER: What?\nJOEY: Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.\nCHANDLER: Are you actually saying these words?\nROSS: What, now you’re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey!\nJOEY: Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a ‘come on’ look.) Yeah, okay.\nMONICA: Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.\nPHOEBE: Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.\nROSS: Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!\nRACHEL: That’s....\nROSS: That’s what?!\nRACHEL: That is neither here nor there.\nROSS: Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.\nRACHEL: No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?\nROSS: Okay, okay, okay.\nRACHEL: (softly) I think you should go.\nROSS: What?\nRACHEL: (softly) I really think you need to go now.\nROSS: (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay.

Okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and....\nRACHEL: (crying) No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything.

Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?\nCHANDLER: You don’t think I get up when you get up?\nJOEY: Ohhh, here it comes.\nCHANDLER: Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!\nJOEY: Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!\nCHANDLER: And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?\nJOEY: That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...\nCHANDLER: I know what you meant!!
