I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was. ALL: Who? JOEY: All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty. ALL: Wow! JOEY: Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to\nkiss this guy. CHANDLER: 'Cause he was just so darn cute. JOEY: No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy\nkisses. ROSS: Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. (Rachel looks at\nhim in disbelief) Or you just do it. JOEY: I did do it, I'm a professional. MONICA: Then what's the problem? JOEY: See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'.\nCan you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good\nmother. PHOEBE: Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about\nkissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh. OPENING CREDITS [Scene: continued from earlier] CHANDLER: Hey, what did your agent say? JOEY: Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on\nMonday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over\nhere and kiss me. MONICA: What, forget it! RACHEL: Yeah, right. JOEY: Come on, I need your help here. PHOEBE: All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again. JOEY: You see this, this is a friend. PHOEBE: Uh-huh, let's go. (they move in to kiss) Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. (they kiss\nrather passionately) Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend. JOEY: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem? MONICA: Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up\na little, maybe that's what you need to work on. JOEY: Yeah, that makes sense. (looks at Ross) ROSS: Over my dead body! (Joey looks at Chandler) CHANDLER: And I'll be using his dead body as a shield. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Monica, and Richard are there] ROSS: (entering from Rachel's bedroom) Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good!\n(turns around, and under his breath, to the rest of the guys) Tell her she looks good,\ntell her she looks good. (Rachel enters in this hideous pink bride's maid dress, with a huge silver bow on her\nchest, and a big, huge skirt, kinda like the one's women wore in the 1800s, Monica and\nRichard both stare in shock) PHOEBE: (laughing) Oh my God, you look so good! RACHEL: I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking\nlike something you drink when your nauseous.",

I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was. ALL: Who? JOEY: All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty. ALL: Wow! JOEY: Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to\nkiss this guy. CHANDLER: 'Cause he was just so darn cute. JOEY: No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy\nkisses. ROSS: Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. (Rachel looks at\nhim in disbelief) Or you just do it. JOEY: I did do it, I'm a professional. MONICA: Then what's the problem? JOEY: See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'.\nCan you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good\nmother. PHOEBE: Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about\nkissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh. OPENING CREDITS [Scene: continued from earlier] CHANDLER: Hey, what did your agent say? JOEY: Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on\nMonday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over\nhere and kiss me. MONICA: What, forget it! RACHEL: Yeah, right. JOEY: Come on, I need your help here. PHOEBE: All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again. JOEY: You see this, this is a friend. PHOEBE: Uh-huh, let's go. (they move in to kiss) Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. (they kiss\nrather passionately) Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend. JOEY: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem? MONICA: Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up\na little, maybe that's what you need to work on. JOEY: Yeah, that makes sense. (looks at Ross) ROSS: Over my dead body! (Joey looks at Chandler) CHANDLER: And I'll be using his dead body as a shield. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Monica, and Richard are there] ROSS: (entering from Rachel's bedroom) Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good!\n(turns around, and under his breath, to the rest of the guys) Tell her she looks good,\ntell her she looks good. (Rachel enters in this hideous pink bride's maid dress, with a huge silver bow on her\nchest, and a big, huge skirt, kinda like the one's women wore in the 1800s, Monica and\nRichard both stare in shock) PHOEBE: (laughing) Oh my God, you look so good! RACHEL: I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking\nlike something you drink when your nauseous.",
