MONICA: Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies. CHANDLER: And twenty-five it is. JOEY: You gave him cookies? MONICA: Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're\nbroke, but cookies do say that. PHOEBE: I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick. CHANDLER: Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?

[Rachel walks off]\nHey Gunther, you got stairs in your place? GUNTHER: Yeah. ROSS: Here, go nuts. [gives him the Slinky and goes and sits with others at the couches] ROSS: Hey guys. CHANDLER, MONICA, and JOEY: Hey. CHANDLER: What's in the bag? ROSS: Um, just some presents. JOEY: C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to. ROSS: [childishly] OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh. MONICA: Cute. ROSS: I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse\nfor mom. [Ross holds up the blouse. It is extremely tacky, with sewn-on medals hanging off of it.] MONICA: Ross, that is gorgeous! ROSS: Yeah? MONICA: Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed\nat the make-believe military academy. [Phoebe enters.] PHOEBE: Hey. GANG: Hey. Hi Phoebe. PHOEBE: Happy Christmas Eve Eve.

CHANDLER: Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame. PHOEBE: No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you. RACHEL: Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison. PHOEBE: No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born. RACHEL: How have you never been on Oprah? PHOEBE: [showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture\nbefore she died, same guy. MONICA: Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue\nscreen with a collie. PHOEBE: It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK,\nI have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave] MONICA: Oh, wait a minute honey. GANG: Phoebs. [Phoebe leaves] MONICA: Wow. JOEY: So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . . GANG: Joey! JOEY: Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears! [Scene: Phoebe's grandmother's place. Phoebe's grandmother is sitting at the table,\nreading the obituaries, and crossing out names in the phonebook.] GRANDMOTHER: Esther Livingston. [scratches out name] Gone. [Phoebe enters.] GRANDMOTHER: Hi, Phoe. PHOEBE: Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'? GRANDMOTHER: Oh, just updating the phonebook. PHOEBE: Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again? GRANDMOTHER: [nervously] Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come? PHOEBE: Just, you know, to see... um. GRANDMOTHER: Oh, sure, yeah. [gets a box with the pictures] This is the one of you father\nin a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . .\nanother graduation. . . another graduation. PHOEBE: OK, is this really my father? GRANDMOTHER: Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is. PHOEBE: OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire. GRANDMOTHER: Look, I. . . PHOEBE: Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you\nhave never lied to me. GRANDMOTHER: Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame. PHOEBE: Oh God. GRANDMOTHER: It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real\nfather because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it,\nbut, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but\nharder. PHOEBE: Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he\ndoesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones? GRANDMOTHER: Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate. PHOEBE: OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist? GRANDMOTHER: Honey. PHOEBE: [realizes] Oh. GRANDMOTHER: Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. [pulls apart a frame and pulls a\npicture out] This is the real him. PHOEBE: Oh. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel, Chandler, and Joey are decorating the\nChristmas tree.] CHANDLER: Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black\nboots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to\nsee him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up. RACHEL: Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas. CHANDLER: Who said anything about Christmas? [Monica and Ross enter.] MONICA: Hi. ROSS: Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet? RACHEL: No, nothin'. MONICA: I hope she's OK. JOEY: Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through. MONICA: How do you know exactly what she's going through? JOEY: She told us. CHANDLER: So whaddya got there Monica? MONICA: Just some stuff for the party. ROSS: Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping? MONICA: You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya\ngonna do? CHANDLER: Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that? RACHEL: Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the\nornaments your mom sent. [hands her a smashed box] MONICA: Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough. JOEY: Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
